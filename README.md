# pisco

A easy to use (very easy) tiny framework in C++ which provides methods for the control of interfaces and events to programming ascii games or another thing.   
pisco is written especially for the students of Introducción a la Programación of Tecnicatura en Videojuegos de UNL-FICH, Argentina.
It works only on Windows (at the moment) and **does not use conio**.
  At the moment pisco provides interfaces for the control of the screen, keyboard and time. Coming soon: Threads and Text-based sprites
